                        My name is Elizabeth Dawson, and I'd like to share some information about myself.
                        I have a history degree and two minors in museum studies and theatre performance from the University of Delaware. In addition, I have a graduate certificate in Historic Preservation from the University of Delaware.</ul>
                        I am interested in history, theatre, music, historic preservation, museums, dance, libraries, archival work, performance, and historical/geneaological research.     
                        Some of my hobbies include reading, singing, acting, and knitting.
