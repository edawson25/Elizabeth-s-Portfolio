                <h1>Brief About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    "I rather think that archives exist to keep things safe – but not secret.” 
                -Kevin Young 
                </p>
                <p>My philosophy: 
                To work effectively while processing and creating information swiftly. I enjoy the challenge of learning and adapting within a new work environment. Collaboration and teamwork are an important concept of a job because I thrive in a group environment. Additionally, I work well independently and keep myself on task because of self-pacing. Following setbacks, I return to the start of the project, reassess the situation, compartmentalize tasks, and cautiously begin the process again.
                </p>
                <h2>Research Interest</h2>
                <p>I am interested in history, theatre, music, historic preservation, museums, dance, libraries, archival work, performance, and historical/geneaological research.  </p>
