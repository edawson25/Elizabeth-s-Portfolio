    <p>My philosophy is to work effectively while processing and creating information swiftly. I enjoy the challenge of learning and adapting within a new work environment. Collaboration and teamwork are an important concept of a job because I thrive in a group environment. Additionally, I work well independently and keep myself on task because of self-pacing. Following setbacks, I return to the start of the project, reassess the situation, compartmentalize tasks, and cautiously begin the process again.</p>
